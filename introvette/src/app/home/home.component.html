      <h2>Yvette Rosario</h2>
      <p>Hey there, I'm Yvette! It's a pleasure to meet you! Originally hailing from the stunning shores of Pohnpei, Micronesia, I've now made Charlotte, North Carolina my home. Recently, I made a bold career move, transitioning from being a restaurant general manager to pursuing my dream of becoming a software engineer.

My passion lies in developing apps that not only wow users but also bring about positive change. I thrive on creating cutting-edge management solutions that push the boundaries of what's possible. After an intense and rewarding 19-week bootcamp at Hack Reactor, I'm now fully equipped to embark on my journey as a web developer and add tremendous value to any team I join.

The future is bright, and I'm ready to seize it, one line of code at a time!</p>
