        <p>Hello there! I'm Yvette ☺️ I'm originally from Pohnpei, Micronesia and now based in Charlotte, North Carolina. I have recently transitioned from working as a restaurant manager to pursuing a career in software engineering, leveraging skills that are essential in the tech sector. My aim is to create apps that have a positive impact on users and provide cutting-edge management solutions. After completing a rigorous 19-week bootcamp at Hack Reactor, I am ready to embark on my journey as a web developer and add value to any team.</p>
